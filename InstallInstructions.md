Download the installation files (HCMCalc_InstallProject.msi and setup.exe) from the link provided in my Email message.  Place these files in any folder on your computer and then run 'setup.exe'. These two files can be deleted once the installation is complete.

HCM-CALC only runs on the Windows operating system and 64-bit CPU architecture. You also need version 7, or higher, of the .NET Desktop Runtime installed on your computer. The installation process should give you a warning if you do not have the required version of the .NET Desktop Runtime and give you an option to download and install it from Microsoft's website. But if you have any problem starting the program after installation, this should be the first thing to check.  You can check which version of .NET you have installed in your Programs and Features section of the Control Panel.  If needed, you can download the latest version, for free, from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0">.NET Desktop Runtime download link</a>. On this page, find the section for the most recent version of the .NET Desktop Runtime. From there, select the 'x64' Windows OS option.
