Current Release Version Date: October 2020

The revisions from the previous version (April 2019) include the following:

<p><b>Two-lane Highway Facility module</b></p>
<p>1) Since the new two-lane highway methodology developed from <a href="http://www.trb.org/main/blurbs/177835.aspx">NCHRP Project 17-65</a> is now officially included in the HCM, this module is now considered official and thus the 'prototype' information screen has been removed from the module. The superseded two-lane highway segment module remains for now, but will eventually be deprecated.</p>
<p>2) Updates to the file creation utility for the SwashSim microscopic traffic simulation program</p>
<p></p>
