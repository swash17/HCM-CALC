<hr />

Download the installation files (HCMCalc_InstallProject.msi and setup.exe) from the link provided in my Email message.  Place these files in any folder on your computer and then run 'setup.exe'. These two files can be deleted once the installation is complete.

You need version 4.6.1, or higher, of the .NET Framework. The installation process should give you a warning if you do not have the required version of the .NET Framework.  But if you have any problem starting the program after installation, this should be the first thing to check.  You can check which version of the .NET Framework you have installed in your 'Programs and Features' section of the Control Panel.  If needed, you can download the latest version, for free, from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345">here.</a>
